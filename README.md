This is our gradebook for our APCS Term 1 final project. We plan for it to run locally and be able to manage a class of students, along with information for each student, such as name, ID, email, password, and, of course, grades! 

There will be options for teachers, students, and parents to log in, all of which will offer different features 

Teachers will get the most options, as they can add students and their log in information, and some elements that cannot be changed, such as ID and Name

Students will be able to view their grades and change the email and password they use to log on, as well as leave comments for their teacher

Parents will be able to login and see that their child has an 100 in every class, regardless of actual performace.

#----------HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM----------
You can simply compile Woo.java and run the file with the following commands
` $ javac Woo.java 
` $ java Woo 

You then will pick whether you are a student, teacher, or parent, and enter in your login info, and menu prompts will direct you to the various options you can choose!
