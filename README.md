<p> This is our gradebook for our APCS Term 1 final project. We plan for it to run locally and be able to manage a class of students, along with information for each student, such as name, ID, email, password, and, of course, grades! </p>
<br> There will be options for teachers, students, and parents to log in, all of which will offer different features 
<br> Teachers will get the most options, as they can add students and their log in information, and some elements that cannot be changed, such as ID and Name
<br> Students will be able to view their grades and change the email and password they use to log on, as well as leave comments for their teacher
<br> Parents will be able to login and see that their child has an 100 in every class, regardless of actual performace.

<br> ----------HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM----------
<br> Not possible yet, but when it is ready to be run, you can simply compile Woo.java and run the file with the following commands
<ul> <li> javac Woo.java </li> <li> java Woo.java</li></ul>
<br> You then will pick whether you are a student, teacher, or parent, and enter in your login info, and menu prompts will direct you to the various options you can choose!
